BBC Radio 1 Chart to Google Music Playlist

## Why
I like the music BBC Radio 1 presents, but I am not big fan of listening to a radio - I like music not talking. This tool let's you automatically generate playlist from current BBC Radio 1 Official Chart which should be list of the most popular songs in UK - this promises certain level of quality (if you like mainstream, obviously).

## How
As you can see, there is nothing implemented yet, but I hope to get it done soon. I want to parse BBC Radio 1's chart site and then use Simon Weber's https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API to query for songs and add them to some playlist. I am thinking of hosting this on Openshift so that it can run without any manual interaction and playlist would just appear in my Google Music All Access profile regularly...we will se..:)
